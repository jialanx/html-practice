        <p>Bob and June met at a Coffee Shop 17 years ago. Back then, they were busy scrambling to rush to their classes. Unfortunately, Bob spilled coffee onto June. Bob said he would pay for it and left his number. <br>
        Just earlier this year, Bob proposed to June in this very same Coffee Shop. The barista had held up a sign, <em>"Will you marry me."</em>  Bob stood there with flowers and with his fancy new suit. Her eyes glistened and she said <strong>"Yes!"</strong></p>
